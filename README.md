# HyperOpt-Algorithms
Collection of scripts designed for hyperparameter optimization using various state-of-the-art techniques such as random search, Bayesian optimization, Hyperband pruners, and evolutionary computation methods like differential evolution. The scripts cater to different machine learning models, aiming to simplify and expedite the process of choosing the most effective set of hyperparameters for your model.

## Contents
- Optuna script for hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization, with Hyperband pruner, illustrated on an MLP model with the MNIST dataset.
- Further scripts implementing other optimization methods coming soon!

## Acknowledgements
- PyTorch for the MLP model and MNIST dataset.
- Optuna for the hyperparameter tuning framework.

Please note that the above script is an example of using Optuna, a Python library for hyperparameter optimization, with PyTorch on the MNIST dataset.
